# crispmacs

`crispmacs` is a WIP implementation of Emacs from scratch in Rust.

## Language

I'll be implementing a Lisp that looks more like Rust (called `crisp`)
using [nom](https://docs.rs/nom/7.1.0/nom/index.html).

## Editor

- [ropey](https://docs.rs/ropey/1.3.2/ropey/index.html) as data structure
- [egui](https://docs.rs/egui/0.16.1/egui/) for user interface
